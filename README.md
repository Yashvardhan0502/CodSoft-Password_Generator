# CodSoft-Password_Generator

This Python script defines a password generator program. It prompts the user for password criteria including length, uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and special characters. Based on the user's preferences, it generates a random password containing the selected character types of the specified length. The generated password is then displayed to the user. The script uses the string and random modules to create and select characters for the password. If no character types are selected, an error message is displayed. The program is executed when the script is run.
