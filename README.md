This Python code implements a Rock, Paper, Scissors game with user-friendly interactions. Players input their choice as numbers (1 for Rock, 2 for Paper, and 3 for Scissors), and the computer randomly selects its choice. The winner of each round is determined based on the game rules, with scores tracked for both the user and computer. The game provides clear results, updates the score after each round, and allows users to play multiple rounds. It offers an engaging user experience while maintaining a simple and efficient structure.
